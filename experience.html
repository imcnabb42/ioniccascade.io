          <ul>
            <li>Speaker recruitment • public outreach • website maintenance • facilitating webinars</li>
            <li>Data Analyst • Analyzing time-series survey polls related to weekly interviews and recent hires by utilizing Python’s pandas, NumPy, SciPy. Plotly, and scikit-learn, via machine learning to plot trends and forecast results</li>
            <li>Tech Support • Assisting with A/V support for speaker presentations, both in-person and remotely</li>
            <li>Program manager • Coordinating remote meetings for fellow job seekers via Zoom and Microsoft Outlook regarding networking groups, exchanging relevant resources and job postings, providing thorough resumé workshops, resulting in about a dozen members obtaining a new job quicker than doing it solo</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>ANDROMEDA DATA LAB</strong> • Data Analyst Consultant • project group with job seekers • July 2019 to Mar 2020</li>
          <li><a href="https://borza.com/"><strong>BORZA</strong></a> • Backend Developer Consultant • B2B eCommerce start-up • Dec 2017 to Apr 2019</li>
      </ul>
      &emsp;<a href="http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/">KAVLI INSTITUTE for ASTRONOMY and ASTROPHYSICS</a> at <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/"><b>PEKING UNIVERSITY</b></a> • Doctoral Candidate • Beijing, China • 2009 to 2016
      <ul>
        <li>Published 2 research papers in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras">MNRAS</a>)</li>
        <li>Wrangled emission spectroscopy data on planetary nebulae from dozens of other articles to be used in a meta-analysis of chemical abundances in planetary nebulae and ran the spectroscopy through automated pipeline</li>
        <li>Automated the pipeline in IDL to read in averaged 2D spectroscopy data, having removed known sky lines, and fitted emission line profiles with randomized Gaussian profiles</li>
        <li>Developed and optimized pipelines in IDL to analyze high-resolution optical spectra for dozens of nebulae</li>
      </ul>
      &emsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/">NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER</a> • Research Analyst • Moffett Field, CA • 2007 to 2009

        <li>Developed and optimized pipelines via routines and subroutines in IDL to analyze emission lines to determine chemical discrepancies in galactic and extragalactic planetary nebulae and H II regions</li>
        <li>Automated the pipeline to read previously manually inputted ASCII results from a Fortran program that calculated chemical abundances in nebulae, inputted the results into the IDL pipeline, and compared results via linear regression with models, thereby reducing human error and the need for addenda or retractions</li>
        <li><b>Technical Project Manager</b> • supervised local high school students to help with research projects, provided documentation and cookbooks for future reference</li>
